The ICU License of ICU 57.2 is considered compatible as the X license, hence
the MIT License. See the un-HTML'ed quote of icu4j/readme.html from ICU4J 57.2.

> The ICU projects (ICU4C and ICU4J) use the X license. The X
> license is suitable for commercial use and is a recommended free software license
> that is compatible with the GNU GPL license. This became
> effective with release 1.8.1 of ICU4C and release 1.3.1 of ICU4J in
> mid-2001. All new ICU releases will adopt the X license; previous ICU
> releases continue to utilize the IPL (IBM Public License). Users
> of previous releases of ICU who want to adopt new ICU releases will
> need to accept the terms and conditions of the X license.
>
> The main effect of the change is to provide GPL compatibility.
> The X license is listed as GPL compatible, see the GNU page at 
> http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses.
> This means that GPL projects can now use ICU code, it does not
> mean that projects using ICU become subject to GPL.
> 
>  The IBM version contains the essential text of the license, omitting the
> X-specific trademarks and copyright notices. The full copy of
> ICU's license is included in the download
> package.
